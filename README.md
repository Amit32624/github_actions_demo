# The foundation of DevOps is continuous integration. Without automated testing, there is no way to move forward with DevOps.
# One of the most straightforward ways to implement continuous integration for the projects is with GitHub Action.

# In this example, I want to check a specific version of Python that runs on Azure. The continuous integration steps are trivial to implement Makefile:
  
  
- [Repo](https://github.com/Amit32624/github_actions_demo> "<github_actions_demo> Repo")


## Makefile
-  A Makefile runs “recipes” via the make system, which comes with Unix-based operating systems. Therefore, a Makefile is an ideal choice to simplify the steps involved in continuous integration.
  -`Make install` - This step installs software via the make install command
  -`Make int` - This step checks for any syntax eror with the make lint command
  - `Make test` - This step runs test viis the make test command.
